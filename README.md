# Dash - Peer 2 Peer Lending Decentralized Application
## _A Moralis X Google Cloud Hackathon Project_

Dash is a closed network peer to peer lending DAPP, which means you have the full control of who can lend or borrow money(cryptocurrencies) from you.
You can build your contact/network list on your dash account just like a messaging application. Whoever is in your contact list can borrow some tokens from the liquidities you have provided in your account.
Dash works with any ERC20 tokens but for testing purposes it supports 3 stable coins launch on fantom testnet network.

## How does it work?
- Go to https://dash-P2p.netlify.app to access the Dapp.
- Connect your wallet to authenticate your account.
- Go to contacts, add a new contact by search them with their username.
- Go to https://dash-P2p.netlify.app/faucet to mint some test tokens.
- Lauch dapp, and go to liquidity tab, and a new liquidity with some of the test tokens from the faucet.
- Now your contacts list can now see your liquidities, and take some of it as a loan.
- Your contact list will repay back the exact loan tokens and interests in dash tokens, interests are calculated in dash per 24h.
- Yaaay! You go lend to a contact and earned from it, cool now what?

## Why Dash?
#- Automatic loan reminder
  You don't have to manually reminder your contacts to repay their loan or when to repay their loans, its features comes with dash right out of the box.
#- Safe lending
  Assessing people for loan is not possible except your are a bank organization, dash protects far better than natural lending by setting a min credit score on your liquidity, and allowing only a contact that is not
already on a loan to take another loan from you.
  So if you want to safely lending out funds to people, dash is the right choice for you.
#- Immutable 
  On liquidities and loans transactions are recorded on the blockchain, with give to a full tracking and back logs of old activities. This can be very useful for resolving disputes between you and contacts.
#- No more stress
  Now all your have to do is added your friends, family or colleagues to your contact list and relax. Your contact get the loan they needed on time without disturbing you.
