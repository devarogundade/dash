# Dash - Peer 2 Peer Lending Decentralized Application
## _A Moralis X Google Cloud Hackathon Project_

Dash is a closed network peer-to-peer lending DAPP, which means you have full control over who can lend or borrow money(cryptocurrencies) from you.

You can build your contact/network list on your dash account just like a messaging application. Whoever is on your contact list can borrow some tokens from the liquidities you have provided in your account.

Dash will support all major stablecoins on fantom but for testing purposes, it supports 3 stablecoins(Fantom USD, USDT, and USDC) we have created on the fantom testnet network.

## How does it works?
Dash allows you to create pools of liquidy with different criteria, people from your dash contact list that met this criteria can take a loan from the pool and fund back to the liquidity pool or your wallet with the exact amount of stablecoins they borrow and some DASH tokens as interest at the 
time of repaying the loan.

## Guides to use?
- Go to https://dash-p2p.netlify.app to access the Dapp.
- Connect your wallet to authenticate your account.
- Go to contacts, and add a new contact by searching for them with their username.
- Go to https://dash-p2p.netlify.app/faucet to mint some test tokens.
- Launch dapp, go to the liquidity tab, and a new liquidity with some of the test tokens from the faucet.
- Now your contacts list can now see your liquidities, and take some of it as a loan.
- Your contact list will repay back the exact loan tokens and interests in dash tokens, interests are calculated in dash per 24h.
- Yaaay! You just lend to a contact and earing from it, cool now what?

## Why Dash?
- # Automatic loan reminder
  You don't have to manually reminder your contacts to repay their loan or when to repay their loans, this features comes with dash right out of the box.

- # Safe lending
  Assessing people for loan is not possible except your are a bank organization, dash protects far better than natural lending by setting a minimum credit score on your liquidities, and allowing only a contact that is not already on a loan to take another loan from you.

  So if you want to safely lending out funds to people, dash is the right choice for you.

- # Immutable 
  On liquidities and loans transactions are recorded on the blockchain, with give to a full tracking and back logs of old activities. This can be very useful for resolving disputes between you and contacts.

- # No more stress
  Now all your have to do is added your friends, family or colleagues to your contact list and relax. Your contact get the loan they needed on time without disturbing you.
